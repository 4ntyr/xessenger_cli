# Threat Model

This document defines what Xessenger is designed to protect against and what it
explicitly **cannot** protect against. Xessenger does not claim absolute
security; it aims for the properties expected from a modern secure messenger,
using only well-established cryptographic constructions (see
`docs/protocol.md`).

## Assets

| Asset | Sensitivity |
|---|---|
| Long-term identity private key (Ed25519) | Critical — never leaves the device, stored encrypted at rest |
| Peer identity public keys + verification state | High — tampering enables MITM |
| Session keys / ratchet state | Critical — exist only in memory, never persisted, never logged |
| Message plaintext | High — exists only in memory and (optionally) in the in-memory history |
| Configuration (name, listen address) | Low |

## Adversary model

We assume an adversary who can:

- **Passively observe** all network traffic (ISP, LAN, compromised routers).
- **Actively modify, inject, drop, reorder, duplicate and replay** traffic.
- **Impersonate any display name** and control any number of malicious clients.
- **Attempt man-in-the-middle attacks** on every connection, including key
  substitution during the handshake.
- **Compromise network infrastructure** entirely (DNS, routers, NATs).
- Obtain a peer's **long-term identity key after the fact** (e.g. stolen
  backups) and try to decrypt previously captured traffic.
- Collude with **untrusted/malicious peers** that a user talks to.

## Protected against

| Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Passive network interception | All payloads encrypted end-to-end with AES-256-GCM; keys never on the wire |
| Active network interception / modification | AEAD authentication tags; any modified bit → decryption failure → message dropped |
| MITM attacks | Handshake transcript signed with both peers' long-term Ed25519 keys; attacker cannot forge either signature without the private key |
| Peer impersonation ("I am alice") | Identity = Ed25519 public key, not the display name; names are never proof of identity; `/fingerprint` and `/verify` provide out-of-band comparison |
| Key substitution | Trust store records each peer's key; a changed key triggers a prominent `!!! SECURITY WARNING !!!` and marks the connection UNTRUSTED — never silently accepted |
| Message modification | AEAD tag + signed handshake; header fields are authenticated as additional data |
| Message replay | Per-session monotonic sequence numbers + sliding replay window; duplicates rejected |
| Duplicate message injection | Same replay window; already-seen sequence numbers are dropped |
| Message ordering manipulation | Sequence-number window detects gaps/out-of-order delivery beyond the window; too-old messages rejected |
| Session hijacking | An attacker who did not complete the signed handshake has no session keys; injected packets fail AEAD authentication |
| Compromised network infrastructure | All security is end-to-end between the two endpoints; relays/routers see only ciphertext |
| Compromised/untrusted peers | Unverified peers are displayed as `SECURE / UNVERIFIED`; peers whose key changed are `UNTRUSTED` and their traffic is surfaced with warnings; users can `/disconnect` them |
| Compromised long-term identity keys | Forward secrecy: sessions are keyed by ephemeral X25519 and advanced by a symmetric ratchet; stealing an identity key does not decrypt previously captured sessions (but does allow future impersonation — hence fingerprint verification) |
| Local key theft (offline) | Identity file encrypted with PBKDF2-SHA-256 (600k iterations) + AES-256-GCM with a random per-file salt; file permissions 0600 |

## Not protected against

Xessenger cannot protect against:

- **Fully compromised endpoint.** Malware with access to process memory can read
  keys and plaintext. No application-level cryptography can prevent this.
- **Keyloggers / screen capture.** Input and displayed output are outside the
  cryptographic boundary.
- **Compromised operating system or hardware** (malicious kernel, hypervisor,
  firmware).
- **The user voluntarily trusting a malicious fingerprint.** `/verify` is only
  as strong as the out-of-band channel used to compare fingerprints.
- **Physical compromise of an unlocked device** while the application is
  running (session keys are in memory).
- **Traffic analysis.** An observer can see *that* two IP addresses communicate,
  connection timing and approximate message sizes. No padding/mixing is
  provided.
- **Denial of service.** An attacker can drop packets or exhaust resources;
  availability is not guaranteed.
- **Endpoint display-name confusion.** Two peers may pick the same name; the
  fingerprint — not the name — is the identity. The UI always shows trust
  state next to peers.

## Logging policy

Debug logging must never include private keys, session keys, plaintext
cryptographic secrets, or authentication credentials (passphrases). Logging is
safe by default: only non-secret metadata (connection events, peer names,
fingerprints, errors) may be logged.
